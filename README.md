# VOD_system
Project created with Java graphic library JavaFX and OMDb Api. Different types of videos - livestreames, movies, series and events are randomly downloaded from external database and customized for the needs of the application.

Distributors can create videos depending on the amount they have already created. Users are created depending on the number of movies in database. They can watch or buy movies and it depends on the price and their favourite genre. They can also buy a profitable subscription which price can be changed by user.

I've implemented multithreading to simulate customers and distributors behaviour.
